# Adobe GenSolve : Regularization and Shape Identification of polylines

## Overview
This project focuses on the identification, regularization, and beautification of curves in 2D Euclidean space. We have developed an efficient and automated process to analyze polylines (a sequence of connected points). The project emphasizes on regularization and symmetry detection.

## Key Objectives
- **Regularization**: Identify the regular shapes in the given input of polylines and list them.
- **Symmetry Identification**: Detect the symmetrical patterns within the line art to preserve artistic integrity.

## Project Approach
1. **Input Data Representation**: We utilized polylines as the input format, which is defined as a sequence of points in 2D Euclidean space.

2. **Regularization Techniques**: 
   - We implemented algorithms to identify the regular shapes in the polylines, reducing noise and ensuring that the curves are smooth and consistent.
   - CSV files were used to check and validate the regularization process.

3. **Output**:
   - It outputs a list of the regular shapes and the symmetries which model identified.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for developing algorithms and processing data.
- **OpenCV**: Employed for image processing, shape detection, and symmetry analysis.
- **CSV**: Used for storing and validating regularization data.

## How to Use
- Clone the Repository.
- Replace the file name in csv with your path of csv file of polylines.
- Run the python notebook.
